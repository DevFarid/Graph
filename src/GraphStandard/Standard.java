 * Interface for {@code newInstance}, {@code clear}, and {@code transferFrom}

 * initial value" of its type. The meaning of this phrase, indeed the meaning of
 * the "clears" parameter mode in all contracts in the "components" type
 * families, is as follows. If the type {@code T} has a no-argument constructor,
 * then the initial value satisfies the contract of the no-argument constructor.
 * If the type does not have a no-argument constructor, then the initial value
 * satisfies the contract of the constructor call that was used to initialize
 * the variable whose old value is relevant in the contract of the method.
 *
 * @param <T>
